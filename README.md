Hybrid Fraud Detection using Self-Organizing Maps and Artificial Neural Networ

Overview
In this mega case study, we create a robust fraud detection system by combining the power of self-organizing maps (SOM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Our goal is to detect fraudulent credit card applications efficiently.

Part 1: Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

Data Preprocessing

We start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the credit card applications dataset.
Feature scaling is performed using MinMaxScaler to normalize the data.
A SOM with a 10x10 grid is trained on the scaled features.
The SOM visualizes clusters of credit card transactions, helping us identify patterns and anomalies.
Fraud Detection

We locate potential fraud cases by examining specific regions of the SOM.
These regions correspond to clusters of transactions that deviate significantly from the norm.
The identified fraudulent transactions are then transformed back to the original feature space.

Part 2: Going from Unsupervised to Supervised Deep Learning

Creating the Dependent Variable

We create a binary variable indicating whether a customerâ€™s application is fraudulent.
If a customerâ€™s ID corresponds to a detected fraud case, the value is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0.

Part 3: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Model Architecture

We build an ANN with an input layer, a hidden layer (with 2 neurons and ReLU activation), and an output layer (with sigmoid activation).
The ANN learns to predict whether an application is fraudulent based on the transformed features from the SOM.

Training and Evaluation

The ANN is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
After training, we predict the likelihood of fraud for each application.
The resulting predictions are sorted in descending order of fraud probability.
Benefits
Accuracy: The hybrid model combines the strengths of SOMs and ANNs, resulting in improved accuracy.
Real-time Detection: Our system provides real-time predictions for prompt action.
Interpretability: SOMs help visualize clusters, aiding in understanding fraud patterns.
Implementation
We recommend implementing this hybrid model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
By leveraging both SOMs and ANNs, our hybrid approach enhances credit card fraud detection. Letâ€™s make financial transactions safer! ðŸš€
